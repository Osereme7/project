Created gitlab account and cloned the repository after I forked it on my github account
Had to authenticate with my github account
Watched a gitlab video to familiarize myself with the GUI and for further knowledge of gitlab
Created a gitlab-ci.yml to and added it to the repository, the gitlab-ci.yml to test, build in docker and deploy to a docker container
https://gitlab.com/Osereme7/wagtail/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml
Created a repository on dockerhub to push the image to, I also had to authenticate with docker in the file
For that I had to pass masked environmental variables (for my docker login crendentials so its not visible in the code)
I also passed script level variables in order to avoid hard coding
uploaded my instance ssh key as a file variable in my gitlab ci script and changed permissions to 400 for security
I ran wagtails image on port 5000 instead of 80 for additional security
Configured a gitlab runner and Created an IAM role in aws to allow the gitlab runner perform Jobs in my aws instance
Created masked variables for my access keys and secret access keys to avoid hard coding and to prevent security breaches
